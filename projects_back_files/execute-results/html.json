However, forest inventories face major challenges, and there is a need to provide detailed, accurate, regular, and real-time information on forest condition and management, with open access. MONITOR will deliver new methods and tools, as well as validation protocols, paving the way for the implementation of a high-resolution, multi-source, national forest monitoring system for France, including its overseas territories. The methodology is based on satellite and ground-based data and will be directly applicable to other regions. We will provide data analyses that enhance knowledge on the detection, quantification, and attribution of forest responses to global change.</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Short-term staff / trainees: </strong>\n        Luigui Ramirez Parra, Phd\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Website: </strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.pepr-forestt.fr/projets/pc-monitor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pepr-forestt.fr/projets/pc-monitor</a>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"project-card\">\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"color:#007ACC; font-weight:bold; margin-right:6px;\">▶</span>\n        <strong>X-RISKS – Analysis and Management of Multiple Risks for Forest Socio-Ecosystems</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>Funder: PEPR Forestt | Duration: 6 | Years: 2024–2030</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Budget: </strong>\n        5 M€ / 109 k€ (Gédata Paris)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>PI: </strong>\n        Marielle Brunette,  INRAE; Eric Rigolot, INRAE\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>LIF staff: </strong>\n        Alexander Massey, Participant\n      </p>\n      <p>\"The X-RISKS project is based on the observation that forest-related risks are often considered in isolation, independently of one another. Existing studies, for instance, focus on the economic risk following the occurrence of a storm (a drop in timber prices), the environmental risk associated with a wildfire (carbon release, loss of biodiversity), or the impact of geopolitical risks on the supply of the forest-based sector (supply contraction, price increases, substitution effects).\nHowever, in a context of global change, this assumption of independence between risks is no longer relevant. Risks are becoming interconnected, correlated, cascading, and mutually dependent, both temporally and spatially. Addressing the issue of multiple risks therefore becomes a matter of critical importance and calls for a paradigm shift, new tools, and innovative approaches to better inform strategies and guide action.\"</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Website: </strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.pepr-forestt.fr/projets/pc-x-risks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pepr-forestt.fr/projets/pc-x-risks</a>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"project-card\">\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"color:#007ACC; font-weight:bold; margin-right:6px;\">▶</span>\n        <strong>RÉGÉ-ADAPT – “Forest Regeneration and Renewal for the Adaptation of Forest Socio-Ecological Systems to Climate Change”</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>Funder: PEPR Forestt | Duration: 6 | Years: 2024–2030</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Budget: </strong>\n        5 M€ / 93 k€ (Gédata Paris)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>PI: </strong>\n        Georges Kunstler, INRAE; Bruno Locatelli, CIRAD\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>LIF staff: </strong>\n        Lionel Hertzog, Scientific contact for Géodata Paris and Task co-leader\n      </p>\n      <p>\"Climate change is affecting the capacity of forests to provide nature’s contributions to people (NCP), such as timber production or watershed regulation, as well as to support biodiversity. The future adaptation and resilience of forest socio-ecological systems will depend on forest renewal and regeneration—that is, the natural or artificial re-establishment of trees following natural disturbances or harvests. Regeneration trajectories will depend not only on ecological processes but also on management choices, which should reflect societal preferences and values as well as governance contexts.\nWe need a better understanding of how regeneration trajectories will unfold under ongoing climate change, how we can manage them to promote forest adaptation while preserving biodiversity, soils, and NCP, and how regeneration can be governed.

This dataset will then be used to impute forest attributes across the full set of GEDI signals. The ability to generate realistic forest scenes from TLS data as inputs to DART for LiDAR signal simulation has already been demonstrated within the TOSCA STEM-LEAF and LEAF-EXPEVAL projects. The resulting virtual plots will contribute to densifying the inventory sampling, either by improving predictions at the national scale or by enabling predictions with acceptable uncertainty levels for small-area domains. Sentinel-2 data will then be integrated as auxiliary variables within a more classical multi-source inventory framework. This project aims to deliver an operational method deployable at the national level. It directly contributes (1) to upstream projects supporting the development of the LEAF mission, by proposing operational approaches for exploiting data from a high-energy, large-footprint spaceborne LiDAR, and (2) to the valorization of data from the Copernicus programme.</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Short-term staff / trainees: </strong>\n        Anouk Schleich, Phd\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"project-card\">\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"color:#007ACC; font-weight:bold; margin-right:6px;\">▶</span>\n        <strong>INFORM – Multisource forest inventory : a generic and flexible tool for forest resource estimation and mapping at fine scale</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>Funder: Impact LUE DEEPSURF | Duration: 3 | Years: 2020–2023</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Budget: </strong>\n        137 k€\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>PI: </strong>\n        Cédric Vega, Géodata Paris IGN\n      </p>\n      <p>This projet aims of the project was to develop multi-source forest inventory maps with uncertainty assessment and to test different estimation framework to estimate forest attributes impacted by disturbances</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Short-term staff / trainees: </strong>\n        Ankit Sagar, Phd\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"project-card\">\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"color:#007ACC; font-weight:bold; margin-right:6px;\">▶</span>\n        <strong>MOPROF-CC – Modeling French Forest Production in the Context of Climate Change</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>Funder: ADEME GRAINE | Duration: 4 | Years: 2019–2023</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>PI: </strong>\n        Eric Dufrêne,UMR ESE\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>LIF staff: </strong>\n        Jean-Daniel Bontemps, co-PI\n      </p>\n      <p>The MOPROF project develops forest simulation tools to assess how climate change and management strategies affect French forests at both stand and regional scales.
